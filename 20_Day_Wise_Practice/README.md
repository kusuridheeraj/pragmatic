## Purpose

- Track daily consistency
- See progress over time
- Maintain streak motivation
- Easy to find "what did I solve on this day?"

## Naming Convention

- Folders: `Day_DD_Mon_DD` (e.g., `Day_01_Jan_13`)
- Inside each day folder, create problem folders with problem names
- Each problem should still have README.md and solution files

## Daily Workflow

1. Create folder for today (if not exists)
2. Solve problems
3. Save in today's folder
4. Also categorize in main topic folders (cross-reference)
5. Update PROGRESS.md

**Pro Tip:** You can create symbolic links or just mention in README which category the problem belongs to.
