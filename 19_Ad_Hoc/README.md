# 🎲 Ad-Hoc Problems

Problems that don't fit into standard algorithmic categories - they require creative thinking and problem-specific solutions.

## What are Ad-Hoc Problems?

Ad-hoc problems are those that:
- Don't follow a standard algorithmic pattern
- Require careful reading and understanding
- Need creative, problem-specific solutions
- Often involve simulation, game theory, or mathematical insights
- Common in competitive programming contests

## Categories

### Simulation
Problems that require simulating a process step-by-step.

### Game Theory
Problems involving games, optimal strategies, Nim, etc.

### Mathematical
Problems requiring mathematical insights (number theory, combinatorics, etc.)

### String Manipulation
String problems that don't fit into standard pattern matching.

### Implementation
Heavy implementation problems with no specific algorithm.

### Constructive
Problems where you need to construct a solution that satisfies constraints.

### Misc
Everything else that doesn't fit above categories.

## How to Approach Ad-Hoc Problems

1. **Read Carefully:** Understand exactly what's being asked
2. **Find Patterns:** Look for mathematical patterns or properties
3. **Start Simple:** Try small test cases manually
4. **Think Creatively:** Don't force standard algorithms
5. **Implement Carefully:** These often have tricky edge cases

## Tips

- These problems test your problem-solving creativity
- Don't overthink - sometimes the solution is simpler than you think
- Practice reading comprehension
- Watch out for edge cases and constraints
