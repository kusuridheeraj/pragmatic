## How to Use

1. Study a section from the book
2. Solve the UVa Online Judge problems mentioned
3. Save solutions in corresponding chapter/section folder
4. Document the problem-solving paradigm used
5. Note down key insights

## Book Resources

- **Book Website:** https://cpbook.net/
- **UVa Online Judge:** https://onlinejudge.org/
- **Kattis:** https://open.kattis.com/

## Problem Tracking

Create a `CHAPTER_PROGRESS.md` in each chapter folder:

| Problem ID | Problem Name | Difficulty | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------------|------------|--------|-------|
| UVa 100 | 3n+1 Problem | Easy | ✅ | Classic recursion |
| UVa 101 | The Blocks Problem | Medium | ⏳ | Simulation |

## Tips

- Many problems are on UVa Online Judge (use problem ID)
- Some problems are on Kattis
- Cross-reference with main topic folders for pattern recognition
- Focus on understanding the paradigm, not just solving
