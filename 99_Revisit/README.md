# Revisit

Problems that need to be revisited - either couldn't solve or need more practice.

## Purpose
Save problems here when:
- You couldn't solve them initially
- Solution was too complex to understand
- You want to try a different approach
- You need to strengthen understanding

## Workflow
1. Save the problem here with notes on what you struggled with
2. Study the pattern/concept needed
3. Come back and attempt again
4. Once solved confidently, move to appropriate category folder
5. Update PROGRESS.md

## Tips
- Don't feel bad about problems being here - this is part of learning!
- Document what specifically was difficult
- Set a reminder to revisit (1 week later)
- Track your progress on retry attempts
